There is chaos in CODE-CITY, crime is everywhere and our superhero CHEF has to save the city.  The master-mind of these crimes is the gangsta named BUG. 

Inorder to defeat Mr.BUG , CHEF has to enter the gangsta's secret vault and destroy everything he owns. The vault is highly gaurded and can be opened only by a secret passcode.

CHEF has an Array of length N and he has to pick all the Ai (1<=i<=N) such that there is only one Aj (1<=j<=N) which divides Ai. 

The passcode is the sequence of these Integers arranged in INCREASING order. 

Your task is to find this passcode. 

If there is no such Ai,return -1;

CONSTRAINTS:

1<=N<=2*10^5
1<=Ai<=10^6


INPUT:
1> First line contains an Integer N
2> Second line contains N space seperated Integers describing the array A.

OUTPUT:
IF there is a Passcode:
            Print the count(c) of Integers in the passcode in FIRST LINE
            Print c space seperated Integers in the SECOND LINE
IF there is no passcode:
            Print -1
